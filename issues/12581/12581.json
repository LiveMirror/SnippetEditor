    "Description": "If a new snippet is created by clicking \"New\" button on the toolbar, saving it causes some pain because user gets asked where to save it and it's not possible to point to the snippet tree.\nI think it's better to concentrate all snippet-management functionality around snippet tree and remove button \"New\" from the toolbar.",
