    "Description": "I always store my snippets in my Documents folder (Documents/Visual Studio 2008 (or 2010)/Snippets) as it makes it easier to port my custom snippets between machines.\n \nIt'd be useful if I could also get those snippets loaded into the Snippet Editor.\n \nIt would also get around the problem of having to run the Snippet Editor as an administrator in Win Vista/ Win7 due to UAC locking down the Program Files folder.",
