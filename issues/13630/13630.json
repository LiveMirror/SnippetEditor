    "Description": "Actually I am using this tool to create classes and stored procedures for my n-tier applications. I have a snippet with 82 replacements and the program is so slow that a simple modification takes seconds and seconds to complete. I tested it on several computers but had the same behavior. Please fix this. Anyway thanks for the great tool ;)",

      "Message": "This is probably due to the way snippet replacement highlighting is implemented. From memory I think it scans the code once per replacement variable.\r\nIs your 82 replacements 82 different variables ? Usually snippets only have about a handful of replacement variables, although each variable may be used multiple times.\r\nCan you send/attach a sample snippet ?",
