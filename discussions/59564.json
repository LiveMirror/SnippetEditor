Thanks Bill.</p>\r\n<p>Then I would like to comment, i am not sure if the problem&nbsp;is because related to this tool or is VS2008 itself, but when I use a &quot;Reference&quot; or &quot;Imports&quot; it does not do the references and imports in my code once the snippet is invoked. I am developing in C# by the way.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again bill for this tool.</p>\r\n<p>Take care,</p>\r\n<p>LAM.</p>",
