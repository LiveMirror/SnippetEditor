There's a bit of &quot;fudging&quot; to work with VS and the snippet paths, mainly because the user registry path is not initialized until the user opens up the VS snippet management tool, so the snippet editor does a bit of a dance/jig to create those registry keys if they aren't already there.&nbsp; I don't know what paths custom shells use. You'd have to install on a clean VCP image and inspect the registry. I'd expect it would be similar, and so you should be able&nbsp;to modify the bit in the Setitngs as I did to add VS10.</p>",
