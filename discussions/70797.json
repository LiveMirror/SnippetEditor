It is so easy (as in Solution Explorer in VS IDE) to move by mistake if you keep your finger too long on the mouse. So my question : is it possible to ask the user confirm before to validate the drop ?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>- I think it would be good if we can also copy a snippet between folders. Perharps it is possible but I didn't see it. VB come with many snippets, it would be useful to copy a standard snippet to a specific folder then to change it without lost the standard snippet (it is the case with drag and drop).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>Thanks</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-GB>Dominique</span></p>",
