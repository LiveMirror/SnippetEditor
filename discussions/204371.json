The dollar sign makes life difficult when working in PHP. If I open a snippet where I manually specified the delimiter it correctly detects and uses the delimiter, but I don't see a way to specify it for a new snippet. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, I'd like to set the language field of the snippet to PHP. Once again snippets I set by hand show the custom value, but I don't see a way to set it from inside the interface.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you,</p>\r\n<p>Shane</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
